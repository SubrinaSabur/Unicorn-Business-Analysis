# Unicorn-Business-Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Unicorn E-Commerce Analysis** project aimed to analyze sales data from an online platform between **2015 and 2018**. The primary objective was to uncover insights, identify weak areas, and recommend strategies to boost business growth. By leveraging data exploration, cleaning, and visualization techniques, the project provided a comprehensive understanding of sales performance and profit trends.

## Key Components
The project was structured into four main parts, each contributing to the overall analysis:

1. **Data Exploration**: Utilized SQL to explore sales data and understand key metrics and trends.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Employed spreadsheet tools to clean and prepare data for further analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
3. **Insights Generation**: Analyzed the cleaned data using Tableau to visualize findings and identify critical business issues.
4. **Executive Summary and Presentation**: Compiled an executive summary and developed a presentation to effectively communicate findings and recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For data exploration and analysis.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interaction within Python.
- **Spreadsheet Tools**: For data cleaning and preparation.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and insights generation.
- **Google Colab**: For documenting and executing the analysis process using Python.

## Key Findings
- **Profit Trends**: The profit growth rate surged from 2015 to 2016 but stagnated and declined in subsequent years, despite a linear increase in the number of ordered items.
- **Impact of Discounts**: High discounts ranging from **50% to 80%** on Furniture and Office Supplies correlated with negative profit margins. In 2018, the analysis revealed an inverse relationship between discounts and profits.
- **Sales Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales volume, profit margins, and order numbers were tracked, highlighting areas for improvement.

## Recommendations
To address the identified issues and enhance business performance, the following strategies were proposed:
- **Revise Discount Policies**: Implement a strategic review of discount policies for specific subcategories, including:
  - Machines
  - Binders
  - Tables
- **Focus on Technology Products**: Increase marketing and sales efforts for technology-related products, specifically:
  - Phones
  - Accessories

## Conclusion
The Unicorn E-Commerce Analysis provided valuable insights into the company's sales dynamics and profitability. The recommendations derived from this analysis are expected to guide strategic decisions, improve customer engagement, and drive overall business growth.
